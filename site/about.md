# About Satslice

Satslice increases the accessibility and capabilities of space missions for organizations which would traditionally be limited by budget and expertise. We combine modern engineering practices and technologies in a new approach to nanosatellite missions, providing a previously lacking platform for sharing both on-orbit resources and engineering output.

Specifically, we develop:

* A new form factor based on horizontal “slices” of a commodity cubesat envelope, which radically reduces the price and improves the capabilities of certain types of missions.
* The turnkey Satslice-0 open source reference design, combining modern components and practices in a high performance, easy to use, expandable form factor.
* A multi-application environment, which shares a high performance embedded PC and software-defined radio across different containerized “slices”, each developed and operated by a participating mission.

Satslice focuses on fostering and supporting missions that do not involve a commercial return, and are unlikely to receive commercial funding. Some examples include:

* Amateur radio
* Experimental communications
* Wildlife tracking
* Environmental sensing
* Academic research
* Space education
* Search and rescue
* Meteorology
* Data broadcasting
