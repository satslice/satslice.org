# Form Factor

The basic common needs of all cubesats–such as solar cells, antennas, cooling, and avionics–are far more suited to a planar construction style than a cube. These subsystems benefit from large surface area, but not volume. For example, a single face of a 1U cubesat, as might be used in a typical university mission, offers only around 2W of power–less than a smartphone browsing the web. Even achieving this limited power budget requires the use of very expensive space-specific solar cells.

We propose a new form factor, in which the volume of a traditional spec-compliant 6U cubesat dispenser is divided into five thin slices, instead of cubes. Each slice is equivalent in volume to a 1.2U traditional cubesat, but is flat instead of cubic, approximately 366 x 226 x 22mm. If a different volume is required for a specific payload, the stacking interface can be adjusted to customize the thickness of each slice individually, so long as the total stack thickness adds up to approximately 110mm.
